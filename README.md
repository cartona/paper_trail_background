Allows you to enqueue version creation/deletion as a background job to avoid having business logic blocked by changelog writing.


## Using

First you'll need to setup a job for processing versions:

``` ruby
# The class MUST be named this
class VersionJob < ApplicationJob

  # These are settings you'll probably want, I suggest sidekiq-unique-jobs
  sidekiq_options(
    :queue => "versions",
    :unique_across_queues => true,
    :lock => :until_executed,
    :log_duplicate_payload => true
  )

  # This wires up the background job
  include PaperTrail::Background::Sidekiq
end
```


## Installing

Run this command in your project:

    $ bundle add paper_trail_background

Or install it yourself with:

    $ gem install paper_trail_background
